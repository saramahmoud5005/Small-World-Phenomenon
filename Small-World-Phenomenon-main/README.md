# Small-Word-Phenomenon
The small-world phenomenon is the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances. 
Two main terminologies are of interest to us in this project:
1.	Degree of Separation
Between any two persons, is defined as the shortest chain of links that leads one person to the other.
2.	Relation Strength
Between any two persons, is defined as the total number of common "factors" between each two persons in the shortest chain of links. If there're many shortest chains of links with the same length, the relation strength is then the one with max common "factors".
